Note: If you are facing issues/errors with Create React App, make sure to use [Set React App](https://blog.unwiredlearning.com/react-installation#heading-2-installing-react-with-set-react-app). 
Set React App works in the same way, with the primary difference being that it uses the `.jsx` file format instead of `.js`.
